**Last updated: December 19, 2024**

## Data Collection
Quote Card Creator does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or user information.

## How the Extension Works
- The extension only accesses text that you explicitly select on web pages
- All quote card creation happens locally in your browser
- No data is sent to external servers
- No tracking or analytics are implemented

## Permissions Used
- **activeTab**: To access selected text on the current tab only when you activate the extension
- **contextMenus**: To add the "Quote it" option to your right-click menu
- **scripting**: To display the quote card editor on the webpage
- **host permissions**: To work on any website you choose to use it on

## Third-Party Services
